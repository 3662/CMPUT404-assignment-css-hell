                    Hello! My name is Felipe. I am an honors student at the University of Alberta pursuing 
                    a BSc in computing science. During my program, I took an interest 
                    in reinforcement learning, algorithms and games. I became particularly 
                    interested in AI in games as it combines my favorite areas of study. 
                    I enjoy working on projects that involve designing games, developing 
                    AI in videogames and developing computer programs that play board games 
                    such as Go. During my free time I like to play videogames and watch 
                    football games.   
                </p>

                <h1> My history </h1>
                <h2> Work Experience </h2>
                <h3> Software Developer Co-op at Willowglen Systems </h3>
                <p> 
                    Willowglen Systems develops various industrial automation solutions 
                    including a SCADA host system used to monitor railways. During my 
                    internship I worked on the following tasks:
                </p>
                <p> - Helped improve the prediction accuracy for train arrivals made by the Train Prediction Module in our SCADA system. </p>
                <p> - Designed and developed tools to process and analyze train prediction data using Python and the Pandas library. </p>
                <p> - Made prediction accuracy reports upon a clientâ€™s request. </p>
                <p> - Developed SCADA modules using JavaScript and C++. </p>
                <p> - Wrote and updated documentation.  </p>
                <p> - Fixed bugs. </p>

                <h2> Certificates </h2>
                <h3> Certificate in Computer Game Development </h3>
                <p> I will obtain this certificate upon graduation on June 2022. </p>
                <p>
                    This is a joint certificate between the Faculty of Science and the 
                    Faculty of Arts at the University of Alberta and focuses on interdisciplinary 
                    teamwork. The certificate begins with five intermediate courses that teach game 
                    and design principles, and culminates in a capstone course where teams develop 
                    a complete game using a commercial game engine such as Unity.  
                </p>

                <h2> Courses </h2>
                <p> The following is a list of my favorite courses taken during my program (in no particular order): </p>
                <p> - CMPUT 204 - Algorithms I </p>

                <h1> What do I have to offer? </h1>
                <p>
                    I have hands-on experience working in team projects related to software engineering, 
                    videogame AI and videogame design, as well as formal experience as a software developer. 
                    I know how to apply concepts related to object-oriented design, user interface, design 
                    patterns, unit testing and good software engineering practices during development. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also have knowledge in algorithm design and analysis and know how to apply it
                    to efficiently solve everyday problems.
